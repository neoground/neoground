  Coming soon once we released the first version.

## 🧩 Why We Build Open Source

We don’t just publish code. We build systems that solve problems, respect users, and elevate standards. 
Open source is how we:

- Empower niche communities (e.g. weather tracking)
- Share robust foundations for others to build upon
- Advance ethical, human-centered tech
- Showcase innovation in real-world scenarios

Whether it’s a performance-optimized backend or an elegant UI, our code aims to be practical, readable, and extensible.
